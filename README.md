# 🌌 FoodVerse: Explore Foods as Planets in a 3D Universe

> **“What if nutrition could be explored like a galaxy?”**
> Welcome to **FoodVerse** — a 3D immersive platform that transforms the way people learn about food and nutrition.
> Each planet represents a **food item**, each orbit a **nutrient category**, and each journey a **learning experience powered by AI**.

## 🚀 The Vision

In today’s fast-paced world, people struggle to understand what they eat. Nutritional charts are boring, health apps are cluttered, and learning about food feels like homework.
So we asked: *What if exploring nutrition was as exciting as exploring the cosmos?*

That’s how **FoodVerse** was born — an interactive 3D universe where food comes alive, powered by **AI and creativity**.
